Once you successfully deploy Osso, visit the index path - if you see the Osso login screen, then you're ready to start setting up your instance.

## Setup script

Osso provides a [setup script](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso-rb/blob/main/lib/tasks/bootstrap.rake) to bootstrap your instance with a first user and default OAuth Clients. Separately Osso also provides a [seed script](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso/blob/main/db/seeds.rb) that's more useful for local development and CI testing - we [use it in our Cypress tests](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso/blob/main/cypress/support/index.js#L8).

If you use the Deploy to Heroku button Osso will run this script for you. Otherwise run

```bash
  bundle exec rake osso:bootstrap
```

This task depends on having the ENV variable `ADMIN_EMAIL` set - see our <Link to={useBaseUrl('/docs/deploy/env-variables')}>Environment Variables guide</Link>. You can set this when running this script like so:

```bash
  ADMIN_EMAIL=me@example.com bundle exec rake osso:bootstrap
```

The script will create the first user for that email, and send an email invitation to confirm the account and choose a password. You'll be able to invite subsequent users via email through Osso's admin UI.

## Updates

We recommend maintaining a GitHub repository for your Osso instance. This will let you implement GitHub based deploys on Heroku, utilize Dependabot for package updates, and manage any updates made to the main Osso project using Git.

You can also treat the main Osso repository as an **upstream** remote. Note that Osso uses **main** as the default branch.

The simplest approach is to first **Fork** the main Osso repository to your own account.

Then, from the command line, clone your fork and add the upstream remote:
```bash
  git clone git@github.com:[your-username]/osso.git
  cd osso
  git remote add upstream git://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso.git
```
You can then merge upstream changes to your local clone, and push to your GitHub repo:

```bash
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main main
  git push origin/main
```
You can use GitHub actions, Buildkite, or any CI tool to run Osso's tests as part of your deployment process.
