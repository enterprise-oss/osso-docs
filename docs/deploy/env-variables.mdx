If you Deploy Osso with the Heroku button, some of the these will be set for you, and you'll have the opportunity to set the others as you deploy your instance. Otherwise view your deployment platform's documentation on Environment or Configuration variables. If you're deploying on your own infrastructure, this should help you understand what external services you need for a deployment.

## Core

These are the required building blocks of an Osso instance.

### BASE_URL
**required**

The public, base url for your Osso deployment, used to construct ACS URLs. Not required for Heroku deployments that use [Dyno Metadata](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata). Must include protocol.

_Example Value:_ `https://osso.saasapp.com`

### DATABASE_URL
**required**

The URL to your Postgres database. Heroku will generate this for you when using the deploy to Heroku button or when adding a Postgres addon. Otherwise set this with your own authenticated Postgres URI.

_Example Value:_ `postgres://user:password@ec2-54-165-36-134.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/d5vj7h6o2psidfy0h`

### SESSION_SECRET
**required**

Key used for encrypting Osso sessions for both OAuth and Admin UI. Will be generated by Heroku when using the Heroku deploy button.

_Example Value:_ `9c670917322529f383c1df29e861e2ea21c03d09e30ead661846fa87ebc5b33a`

## Email

Osso uses email to invite users, including the first, to an instance. You need the ability to send email via an SMTP server. If you don't have this ability, we recommend a Mailgun account.

### ADMIN_EMAIL
**required**

As you deploy Osso, set your own email as the `ADMIN_EMAIL` to be invited to the instance.

_Example Value:_ `me@company.com`

### SMTP_LOGIN
**required**

SMTP server login or username.

_Example Value:_ `postmaster@mail.example.com`

### SMTP_PASSWORD
**required**

SMTP server password.

_Example Value:_ `secret-password`

### SMTP_DOMAIN
**required**

A domain your SMTP server is authorized to emails from.

_Example Value:_ `ossoapp.com`

### SMTP_SERVER
**required**

The location of your SMTP server for sending email

_Example Value:_ `smtp.mailgun.org`.

## Pro-tips

### CYPRESS_INSTALL_BINARY
Osso uses Cypress for e2e tests. This prevents yarn / npm from downloading the Cypress binary in your release environment. Not required but recommended.

_Example Value:_ `0`
