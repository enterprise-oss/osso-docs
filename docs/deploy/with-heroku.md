title: Deploying with Heroku
---

The simplest way to deploy an Osso instance is with Heroku via the button below.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso/tree/main)

Heroku will run convenient setup scripts and set required environment variables to get you up and running quickly. You can otherwise deploy Osso anywhere you can deploy Ruby / Rack apps. We plan to offer a Docker image in the future.
