title: Deploying with Heroku

The simplest way to deploy an Osso instance is with Heroku via the button below.

Heroku will run convenient setup scripts and set required environment variables to get you up and running quickly. You can otherwise deploy Osso anywhere you can deploy Ruby / Rack apps. We plan to offer a Docker image in the future.
