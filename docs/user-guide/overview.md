Osso provides an Admin interface for managing SAML Identity Providers and OAuth Clients.

You'll need to configure an OAuth Client for each application to which you want to add SAML-based authentication. You can deploy Osso instances for each of your application environments (dev, staging, production, etc.) or you can use a single deployed instance to serve all of your environments by creating multiple OAuth Clients.

When you need to onboard a customer who requires SAML-based authentication, your team can use the Admin UI to set up and configure the customer's SAML Identity Provider, or you can have your enterprise customer complete this setup themselves.
