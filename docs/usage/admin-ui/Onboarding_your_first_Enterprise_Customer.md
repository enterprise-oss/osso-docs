5. Click **Add new Identity Provider**
6. Click the icon associated with your Customer’s Identity Provider. Click **Next**
7. Click **Download Documentation** and save this to your computer. Click **Done**
8. You will need to email the file from Step 7 to your Customer. Your Customer will need to complete the steps outlined within this document. Your customer contact will need to partner with someone who has Admin access within their Identity Provider, unless they are an Admin themselves. 

Steps 9-11 will require you to upload your Customer’s XML Metadata File to Osso. Your customer will be instructed to email you an XML Metadata File they downloaded from their Identity Provider. When you receive this file from your customer via email, you will need to download it to your computer and upload it into the Customer Profile you created in Osso

9. Click the Customer’s Company Name you created from the Customers list page in the Osso portal. 
10. Click **Complete Configuration** on the right side of the tile with the Identity Provider you created earlier.
11. Click the box with the Mailbox icon and select the XML Metadata File on your computer or drag and drop the XML Metadata File onto the box with the Mailbox icon.

12. Once the file has been uploaded, the text boxes below Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL and X.509 Certificate will both be populated. Click **Done**
13. Reach out to your customer letting them know they are now able to login to your service via their Identity Provider.
