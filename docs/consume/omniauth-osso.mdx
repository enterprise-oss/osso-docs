Osso's Ruby gem `omniauth-osso` helps you integrate your Osso instance with a Rails or other Ruby/Rack based application. It's a provider strategy for the OmniAuth framework thats uses an OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow.

## Examples

- [osso-rails-example](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso-rails-example) - a clean Rails app using omniauth-osso
- [enterprise-oss/forem](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/forem) - fork of Rails app forem which powers dev.to, using omniauth-osso

## Quick start

Integrating `omniauth-osso` is a 3 step process of installation, providing a sign in mechanism and handling sign in callbacks from Osso.

### Install

Add `omniauth-osso` to your Gemfile and run `$ bundle install`. It's highly recommended that you use version `>= 0.2.0` which depends on OmniAuth 2.0. If you can't upgrade to OmniAuth 2.0, be sure to only allow POST requests to your OmniAuth request routes, i.e. `/users/auth/osso`.

```ruby title="Gemfile"
gem 'omniauth-osso', '~> 0.2.0'
```

Then configure your Osso instance in an `OmniAuth::Builder` block:

```ruby title="/config/initializers/omniauth.rb"

```

### Sign in

To kick off a SAML sign in request via Osso, a user must submit a POST request to `/auth/osso`. If you include a query parameter for `email` or `domain`, the user will be routed to their IDP automatically. Otherwise the user will be shown an Osso hosted login page.

For convenience, let's use Osso's hosted login page. Later you can more deeply integrate Osso into your login flow - check out Osso's React library if you use React on your front end.

```ruby title="app/views/application/login.html.erb"
  <%= form_tag("/auth/osso", method: "post") do %>
    <%= submit_tag("Sign in with SAML SSO") %>
  <% end %>
```
