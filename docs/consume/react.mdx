      Osso's React library is still under construction. <code>&lt;OssoLogin /&gt;</code> is fully documented and ready for you to use in your application, but portions of this library for adding SAML configuration flows to your application are still under construction.

Osso offers a React library that you can use to deepen your Osso integration with your application. The package includes high level components for things like a login form as well as lower level hooks and utilities for crafting your own login or SAML configuration features. The library is written natively in Typescript and provides it's own type definitions.

## Get started

### Examples

- [MaterialUI codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/enterprise-oss/osso-react/tree/main/examples/mui)
- [Ant Design codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/enterprise-oss/osso-react/tree/main/examples/ant)
- [Osso](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso) - Osso uses our own React library to build our Admin UI
- [NextJS live demo](https://nextjs-demo.ossoapp.com)
- [NextJS example source code](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso-next-auth-example)

### Install

Install `@enterprise-oss/osso` as a runtime dependency with Yarn or NPM:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm', },
  ]
}>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

  ```bash
    yarn add @enterprise-oss/osso
  ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem value="npm">

  ```bash
    npm install @enterprise-oss/osso
  ```
  </TabItem>
 </Tabs> 

### Setup

After installing the package, you need to use the `<OssoProvider>` component to wrap any Osso components to provide them context about your Osso instance. If you're planning on using the `<OssoLogin>` component then we suggest placing the `<OssoProvider/>` as high up in your application's component tree as possible.

```js title="app.js"
import { OssoProvider } from "@enterprise-oss/osso";
import React from "react";

function App() {
  return (
    <OssoProvider
      client={{
        baseUrl: "https://demo.ossoapp.com",
      }}
    >
    {/* The rest of your application components */}
     </OssoProvider>
  );
}

export default App;

```

The `<OssoProvider>` requires a **client** prop with the following properties.

| Key     | Required | Description |
| ------- | :---------:|-------------|
| baseUrl | **true** | The base URL of your Osso instance, i.e. `https://sso.myapp.com`
| jwt     | false    | A JSON web token authenticating an end user. Utilized for self-serve SAML configuration which is under construction 👷🏽‍♀️

## Components

Osso React components can be divided into two categories - a component for crafting a login form and components that allow your users to configure their own SAML identity providers.

Osso's components make an effort to be "headless" - they handle logic and layout, but allow you to provide your own UI elements to match the look and feel of the rest of your application.

### &lt;OssoLogin&gt;

### SAML Configuration



## Hooks

If Osso's React components don't suit your needs, the library also exposes lower level React hooks that you can use in your own components. 

Our hooks aren't yet fully documented and still under construction, but here are a couple you might find useful. You can find th rest in the [Osso React Github repository](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso-react/tree/main/src/hooks).

### useOssoFields

The `useOssoFields` hook is useful for relaying data about Osso's supported Identity Providers.

You might use this to construct a flow for SAML self-config, or to tell your users which Identity Providers you support without having to hardcode anything.

```javascript
import { useOssoFields } from "@enterprise-oss/osso";
import React from "react";

import styles from "./styles.module.css";

const SupportedProviders = () => {
  const { providers } = useOssoFields();

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      {providers.map((provider) => (
        <img
          key={provider.value}
          src={provider.iconUrl}
          className={styles.image}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SupportedProviders;

```
The above code would produce the following:

<SupportedProviders />

### useOssoLogin

The `useOssoLogin` hook is useful for crafting a login form that supports both SAML and email / password inputs. The hook allows you to call a function that asks the Osso API whether a configured Identity Provider exists for the submitted email. The return tuple for the hook includes this function as well as a `loading` prop.

```javascript

const { providerExists, loading } = useOssoLogin();
  
const checkForProvider = async (email) => {
  const exists = await providerExists(email.split("@")[1]);
  // Do something with existence - if true, start signing the user in via Osso,
  // otherwise display a password field.
};

```

Here's a quick example hooked up to the Osso demo instance:

<CustomLogin />


## Utilities

Osso React provides some utility functions that may be useful to you whether you use an Osso instance or not. 

### documentationWriter

One of the best parts about Osso is our sparkling custom documentation for IDP admins to configure your app in their IDP. 

The `documentationWriter` utility function will interpolate the required data into Osso's raw PDF docs to create a custom document for a customer.

The best place to understand how to use this functionality without Osso is taking a look at the [unit tests](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso-react/blob/main/src/utils/documentationWriter/index.test.js). If you want to use this utility within an OssoProvider, your best bet is to use the `useOssoDocs` hook.

### parseMetadataXML

The easiest way to receive SAML config data back from your customer is to have them send you a federated metadata XML file. 

This utility parses those XML files from all Osso supported IDPs into a JS object with the required values for finalizing config.

```js

import { parseMetadataXML } from '@enterprise-oss/osso'

  const idpMetadata = // An XML string 
  const result = parseMetadataXML(idpMetadata);

  // => {
  //   ssoUrl: 'https://...',
  //   ssoCert: 'MIIDdDCCAlygAwIBAgIGAXPpk/8...'    
  // }

```
