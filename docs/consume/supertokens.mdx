      Osso's SuperTokens integration is under construction.

Osso can be used with SuperTokens as a custom thirdparty provider if you're using SuperTokens with NodeJS.

The Osso team is working on [a PR that would tighten the SuperTokens integration](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/94), allowing developers to skip Osso's hosted login page and send a user directly to their IDP.

While we work on that PR and better documentation here, you can review our sample app [source code](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/osso-supertokens-node-example) or [live example](https://supertokens-demo.ossoapp.com)
