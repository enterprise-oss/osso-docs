Osso can be used with Python Social Auth as a custom backend provider.

The Osso team is working on a PR that would make Osso a first-class supported provider in Python Social Auth.

While we work on that PR and better documentation here, you can review our sample app [source code](https://github.com/enterprise-oss/django-example) for a Django framework example.
