SSO has two flavors of logging in to your application. Identity providers offer a dashboard to their users that display all the applications the user has can access. If a user clicks your app from an IDP dashboard, that's called an IDP Initiated Sign In. On the other hand, if a user visits your website, you should offer a Service Provider Initiated Sign In.

This step isn't strictly necessary to start signing users in as they can access your app from their IDP, but it does result in a stronger sign in user experience. You'll want to involve your product and design teams to help make decisions about how to approach allowing SSO users to sign in to your application. You'll need to ascertain a user's email or domain in order to start the sign in process with Osso - some apps offer separate SSO login forms, while others combine this form with their email / password based login forms.
