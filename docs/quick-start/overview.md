Integrating Osso to your application is a 3-step process that typically takes a couple of hours. You will primarily need back-end engineering skills. A more complete integration should also involve your product and design teams in order to craft a strong sign in experience for SSO users.

Osso also provides React components for integrating Osso flows directly into your application, which would require front-end engineering and a greater time commitment. Osso recommends starting with a base integration before integrating the core flows to your application.
