This guide is for an end user to connect to a Service Provider via OneLogin. If you’re looking to add a new connection for an Enterprise Customer, please read our guide on Adding your first Enterprise Customer.

To configure SSO to log in to a Service Provider’s application, you will need to add a **SAML Test Connector** application inside your OneLogin Administration dashboard. This is typically performed by someone in IT or InfoSec who has administrative privileges to the OneLogin account. When finished be sure to return the **OneLogin Metadata** to your contact at the Service Provider you’re setting up in order for them to complete configuration. 

## Access OneLogin Administration Portal
1. Log in to your OneLogin user account at your-domain.onelogin.com - you will need an account with administrator access to complete this process.
2. Open the Admin dashboard by clicking on the **Administration** link in the top right. 
3. Click **Applications** in the top left of the top navigation bar.
4. Click **Add App** in the top right.
5. Type `SAML Test` in the search field in the top left, and choose the first result shown below, **SAML Test Connector (Advanced)**
