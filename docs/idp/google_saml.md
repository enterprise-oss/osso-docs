This guide is for an end user to connect to a Service Provider via Google SAML. If you’re looking to create a connection for an Enterprise Customer, please read our guide on Adding your first Enterprise Customer

In order to login users via Google SAML, you will need to add a custom SSO SAML application  inside your Google Admin Console. This is typically performed by someone in IT or InfoSec who has administrative privileges to the Google Admin Console account.

Follow the steps below to create an application with information we’ve generated for your account, and when finished be sure to return the **Google IDP Metadata XML** to your contact at the Service Provider so your team can begin signing in with SSO.
